# CS5374 final project

## Advancing Kernel Control Flow Integrity with eBPF
eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) subsystem, a dynamic kernel code execution framework in Linux kernel, runs sandboxed programs in privileged contexts. It effectively enhance kernel functionalities safely and efficiently without modifying source code or adding modules.

This project delves into the eBPF subsystem, prized for its flexibility and efficiency. Motivated by its potential, we aim to understand its workings and explore applications. Guided by insights from the eBPF & Networking session at the Linux Plumbers Conference (LPC) in 2023, we target to replicate select approaches showcased therein. Additionally, we aspire to enhance these methodologies with our innovations.

The eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) subsystem within the Linux kernel facilitates dynamic execution of code in privileged environments, augmenting kernel functionality securely and efficiently without necessitating source code alterations or module additions. Motivated by its potential, this project focuses on understanding and exploring the potential of eBPF. Guided by insights from the eBPF & Networking session at the Linux Plumbers Conference (LPC) in 2023, we target to replicate and refine selected methodologies presented therein. Our current focus lies on implementing and improving eKCFI, as proposed by Jia et al., with the source code available on GitHub.
